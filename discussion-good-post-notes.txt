For Density: Heat maps, hexbin maps, and choropleth maps are effective for understanding spatial distributions and densities.
For Connections: Flow maps and network maps are best suited for visualizing relationships between different locations.
For Influence Zones: Voronoi diagrams help visualize areas of influence, while cluster maps show where certain types of points are concentrated.
For Changes Over Time: Time-enabled maps show how spatial relationships evolve, useful for trend analysis.
